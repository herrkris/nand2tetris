# From Nand to Tetris

This repo contains the implementation of the projects on http://www.nand2tetris.org/

While reading [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.amazon.de/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686) and trying to solve the projects I realized that I needed to write my findings down. Sometimes implemeting certain logic gates were pretty straightforward, other times it took me quite some tinkering to find the solution. In order to not forget how I arrived at a certain solution (I'm looking at you DMux4Way) I'm going to document them in this repo.

Right now this is hopefully going to be udpated on a regular basis.
